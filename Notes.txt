When a redirection happens in a normal html page, the whole page re-renders

But in the react-router the whole page will not be re-rendered


To install react-router dom
npm install react-router-dom

So all the paths when a button is clicked is defined in the NavBar
Once the path is defined, where that path takes is written in the router. If you do not define this, then it will just update in the url but no redirections happen


Now we can look into the difference between the Nav and link


when we are using the Link tag, all the Link components are converted to anchor tags, and they look like
<ul>
  <li><a href="/about" data-discover="true">About</a></li>
  <li><a href="/contact" data-discover="true">Contact</a></li>
  <li><a href="/" data-discover="true">Home</a></li>
  <li><a href="/products" data-discover="true">Products</a></li>
</ul>

But when we use the NavLink in the Navbar, there is something new added to these a tags
<ul>
  <li><a class="" href="/about" data-discover="true">About</a></li>
  <li><a class="" href="/contact" data-discover="true">Contact</a></li>
  <li><a class="active" href="/" data-discover="true" aria-current="page">Home</a></li>
  <li><a class="" href="/products" data-discover="true">Products</a></li>
</ul>
we can observe, class is added to all the 'a' tags and we can see which tag is active
so, now I can add a.active in the css files


When evere we need to use on click submission and how they should be redirecting, we can start using useNavigate()

<button onClick={() => {navigate('/about', {replace:true})}}>Get Started</button>
Whenever we use the replace=true, when clicked on the this button, then when we click back, it will not go to previous page,
because we are replacing the the last page visited navigation stack with this.
Browser somehow stores the pages visited in a stack, but we use {replace:true}, it is not getting added but rather is totally repalcing the page from which it is loading

let say we started the app and we navigated like
home -> products -> about  -> in this case when we click back the order is
about-> products -> Home

But if it is like
home ->contact ->products -> Get started, the back click is
Get Started -> contact -> home ( products page in the stack is replaced by the getstarted)
